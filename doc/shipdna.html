		Ship dna is the data that makes up your ship in terms of modules and ammo. 
		To get this information into the Trivial Fleet Manager you must drag your fitting into a chat window and send it to the server (press enter). 
		Once that is done you can right click on the fitting and copy it to your clipboard. You can then paste that into the ship dna field.
